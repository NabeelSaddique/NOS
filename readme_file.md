A comprehensive web-based tool for conducting Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) risk of bias assessments in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Generate publication-ready robvis-style visualizations for observational studies.

## üöÄ Features

- **Complete NOS Implementation**: Cohort, Case-Control, and Cross-Sectional studies
- **Interactive Assessment Forms**: Step-by-step guided evaluation with star ratings
- **Publication-Ready Visualizations**: robvis-style plots and domain heatmaps
- **Quality Classification**: Automated Good/Fair/Poor quality rating system
- **Data Export**: CSV, JSON, and high-resolution PNG formats
- **Multi-Study Management**: Assess and compare multiple studies simultaneously
- **Academic Integration**: Built specifically for systematic review workflows
- **Research-Grade Output**: Publication-quality plots for journals and conferences

## üéØ Study Types Supported

### Cohort Studies (9-star scale)
- **Selection** (4 stars): Representativeness, non-exposed selection, exposure ascertainment, outcome demonstration
- **Comparability** (2 stars): Confounding factor control
- **Outcome** (3 stars): Assessment method, follow-up length, adequacy of follow-up

### Case-Control Studies (9-star scale)
- **Selection** (4 stars): Case definition, representativeness, control selection, control definition
- **Comparability** (2 stars): Confounding factor control
- **Exposure** (3 stars): Ascertainment method, same method for cases/controls, non-response rate

### Cross-Sectional Studies (8-star scale)
- **Selection** (4 stars): Representativeness, sample size justification, non-respondents, exposure ascertainment
- **Comparability** (2 stars): Confounding factor control
- **Outcome** (2 stars): Assessment method, statistical test appropriateness

## üìñ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Basic Assessment Workflow
1. **Add New Study**: Enter study details and select study type
2. **Complete Assessment**: Answer NOS criteria questions with star ratings
3. **Save Assessment**: Store evaluation with quality classification
4. **Generate Report**: Create publication-ready visualizations

### 2. Batch Processing
```python
# Import multiple studies from CSV
python scripts/batch_assessment.py --input studies.csv --output results.json
```
